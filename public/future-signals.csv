This linear city concept spans 170 kilometers with a height of 500 meters and width of 200 meters, creating vertically distributed communities. The design prioritizes walkability, with all essential services accessible within a 5-minute walk. The city aims to house 9 million residents while maintaining zero carbon emissions through renewable energy integration. This model challenges conventional thinking about urban density, transportation, and the relationship between nature and built environment. The project raises important questions about scalability, social dynamics in vertical communities, and the feasibility of such ambitious infrastructure projects.",line_city.jpg

Rather than sprawling development, it proposes concentrating the entire human population into a single hyper-dense city, allowing the rest of the planet to regenerate naturally. This radical proposition serves as a thought experiment about trade-offs between human habitation and ecological restoration. The model explores how extreme urban density combined with advanced technology could support human life while dedicating vast areas to carbon sequestration, biodiversity recovery, and natural ecosystem restoration. While intentionally provocative and unrealistic as a literal blueprint, it challenges us to rethink the relationship between urbanization and planetary health, questioning whether our current distributed settlement patterns are sustainable in the long term.",planet_city.jpg

At Singapore Design Week, he argued that contemporary urban development prioritizes efficiency and cost over human emotional needs, resulting in environments that make people feel indifferent or even depressed. His critique extends beyond aesthetics to question fundamental assumptions about urban design: Why do we accept buildings that lack personality? How does architectural monotony affect mental health and community cohesion? Heatherwick advocates for architecture that tells stories, creates memorable experiences, and fosters genuine human connection. This perspective challenges the architecture and development industries to reconsider their priorities, placing human emotional wellbeing at the center of urban design decisions rather than treating it as a secondary concern.",emotional_arch.jpg
4,Sign 4,Civic Price,Commoditization of cities,"Because you can see the value, you will one day encounter a city that really suits you","When it becomes possible to quantitatively compare and evaluate, the current way of life will suddenly seem to lose its color.","As the scale of the economy withers more seriously due to the aging of the population and population decrease, it will become difficult to maintain infrastructure facilities in cities. Municipalities are required to make an independent effort to present their attractions in a manner that facilitates comparison with other cities for the purpose of attracting people and industries in order to survive. Against this background, international organizations including the United Nations presented a universal method for measuring the CO2 emissions of each city and actually calculated the emissions of major cities around the world, so various ""indexes to evaluate the urban environment"" have started to appear. These indexes will be used effectively to indicate the characteristics of urban development to associated bodies in the development of special zones. Reduction in the environmental burden will not be the only factor in regenerating a city or establishing a new city. One important factor that might make one city stand out in comparison with others for potential residents may be the extent to which it is equipped with functionality that supports a more diverse set of values, which includes basic performance factors such as safety, security and convenience, participation of aged people in the community, consideration of the work life balance such as proximity of the work place and home and an understanding of diversity.",civic-price.jpg
5,Sign 5,Fluid Workspaces,Redefining office environments to support employee wellbeing and productivity,"""When many are reevaluating how offices impact employee happiness and productivity...""",Architects LeeAnn Suen and Florian Idenburg are reimagining workplace design to prioritize human needs over corporate efficiency.,"The pandemic fundamentally disrupted traditional office paradigms, forcing a wholesale reevaluation of why, when, and how people work in physical spaces. Architects and designers like LeeAnn Suen and Florian Idenburg are leading efforts to reimagine workplaces not as productivity machines but as environments supporting holistic human wellbeing. This shift involves multiple dimensions: spatial flexibility that accommodates diverse work styles and tasks; biophilic design integrating nature; social spaces fostering collaboration and community; quiet zones for focused work; and technology supporting rather than dominating the environment. The emerging model treats offices as amenities that enhance remote work rather than replacing it, offering experiences impossible at home. This transformation has profound implications for urban design, as demand shifts from conventional office towers to mixed-use developments integrating work, life, and play. It also challenges organizations to articulate clear value propositions for physical presence beyond mere monitoring and control.",fluid_workspace.jpg

These sites often occupy valuable urban land but carry environmental contamination, structural complications, and community trauma. Progressive cities are pioneering adaptive reuse strategies that honor industrial heritage while creating new public value. The approach requires deep understanding of each site's unique characteristics: topography, materials, history, and community context. Successful transformations go beyond simple preservation, reimagining these spaces as parks, cultural venues, innovation districts, or mixed-use developments that serve contemporary needs while maintaining historical continuity. This trend reflects growing appreciation for industrial aesthetics, desire for authentic urban experiences, and practical need to accommodate growth within existing city footprints rather than through sprawl. It also represents environmental stewardship, as adaptive reuse typically has lower carbon impact than new construction.",quarry_transform.jpg

Forward-thinking companies are responding by transforming physical stores from transactional spaces into experiential sustainability showcases. KFC's ""Little Green Store"" concept exemplifies this evolution, integrating solar power generation, IoT-based energy management, and educational components that make sustainability visible and engaging. The store functions as both business location and community resource, demonstrating how commercial spaces can contribute to urban environmental goals while maintaining profitability. This model challenges the retail industry to rethink its role: rather than merely selling products, stores become platforms for education, community gathering, and demonstrating sustainable practices. The trend extends beyond individual businesses to influence urban planning, as cities consider how to incentivize or require retail developments to contribute to sustainability goals. It also reflects evolving consumer expectations, particularly among younger generations who increasingly demand that brands align with environmental values through action rather than just marketing.",green_retail.jpg
8,Sign 8,Ecological Infrastructure,Building wildlife crossings and green corridors within urban transportation networks,"""They're building a 'sky bridge' for wildlife over busy highways...""","The passage design is deliberately 'wild' - planted with thick vegetation to appear as part of the mountain, attracting animals to use it safely.","Urban expansion and transportation infrastructure have fragmented natural habitats, threatening biodiversity and increasing human-wildlife conflicts. Ecological infrastructure represents a paradigm shift that integrates wildlife needs into urban and transportation planning from the outset. Wildlife crossings - bridges or tunnels designed specifically for animals - are becoming standard components of highway projects in progressive jurisdictions. These structures do more than prevent roadkill; they maintain genetic diversity by enabling animal movement between isolated populations, support ecosystem health, and reflect growing societal recognition that cities exist within rather than apart from nature. The design of these crossings requires sophisticated understanding of animal behavior, with features like vegetation cover, appropriate dimensions, and strategic placement based on migration patterns. This approach challenges traditional infrastructure planning that optimized purely for human movement efficiency and cost. As climate change forces species migration and cities expand into previously wild areas, ecological infrastructure will become increasingly critical for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services that ultimately support human wellbeing.",wildlife_crossing.jpg
9,Sign 9,Retrofit Revolution,Accelerating building decarbonization through innovative facade systems,"""From old houses to 'eco-friendly homes' - just add a new 'skin'...""","At current speeds, it would take 500 years to complete low-carbon transformation of all European buildings. A German company wants to create a 'fast track'.","Buildings account for nearly 40% of global carbon emissions, with most coming from existing structures that will remain standing for decades. Traditional renovation approaches are too slow and expensive to meet climate targets. Innovative companies like Germany's Ecoworks are pioneering industrialized retrofit systems that dramatically accelerate and reduce costs of building decarbonization. Their approach treats renovation like manufacturing: precisely measuring existing buildings, prefabricating customized facade panels off-site with integrated insulation and systems, then rapidly installing them with minimal disruption to occupants. This ""new skin"" approach can reduce building energy consumption by 70-80% while improving comfort and aesthetics. The model addresses a critical bottleneck in urban sustainability: the existing building stock. It also creates new industries and jobs while preserving housing affordability - crucial as cities balance climate goals with social equity. The trend represents a broader shift toward treating buildings as upgradable systems rather than static structures, enabling cities to meet sustainability targets without wholesale demolition and reconstruction.",building_retrofit.jpg
10,Sign 10,Acoustic Sanctuaries,Creating quiet zones and noise reduction systems in dense urban environments,"""She designed 'noise-canceling headphones' for houses...""","Facing constant outdoor noise, Kristina Loginova previously could only close windows to reduce sound, but she discovered a better solution.","Urban noise pollution affects billions of people worldwide, contributing to stress, sleep disruption, cardiovascular disease, and reduced quality of life. Traditional approaches focus on source reduction or barriers, but designer Kristina Loginova developed a novel solution: adaptive acoustic panels that function like active noise cancellation for buildings. Her system uses microphones to detect external noise patterns, then generates counter-frequencies through external speakers, creating quiet zones without completely sealing off natural ventilation and connection to the outdoors. This innovation represents a growing field of acoustic design that treats sound as a designable element of urban environments rather than an unavoidable nuisance. The trend extends beyond individual buildings to urban planning strategies that create ""quiet zones"" - parks, pedestrian areas, and residential districts protected from traffic noise through spatial planning, vegetation, and surface treatments. As cities densify and mental health concerns grow, acoustic quality is increasingly recognized as essential infrastructure alongside water, energy, and communications. This shift challenges developers, architects, and city planners to consider sound environments as carefully as visual aesthetics or functional efficiency.",acoustic_design.jpg
11,Sign 11,Vehicle-to-Grid Cities,Electric vehicles as distributed urban energy storage and supply systems,"""This Dutch city wants to turn electric vehicles into the city's 'mobile power source'...""",Robin Berg explains the project that combines two major trends: renewable energy proliferation and electric vehicle adoption.,"The convergence of electric vehicle adoption and renewable energy expansion creates unprecedented opportunities for urban energy management. The Dutch ""We Drive Solar"" project pioneered vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems that treat EV batteries as distributed energy storage, absorbing excess solar and wind power when available, then feeding electricity back to the grid during peak demand or renewable generation gaps. This bidirectional flow transforms vehicles from pure consumers to active participants in urban energy systems, enhancing grid stability while providing economic benefits to vehicle owners. The model requires coordinated planning across transportation, energy, and urban design sectors - exactly the kind of systems integration that cities increasingly need. It also shifts the economics of EV ownership, as vehicles generate revenue through grid services, and urban planning, as parking infrastructure becomes energy infrastructure. The trend accelerates the transition to renewable energy by solving the intermittency challenge without massive stationary battery installations. It represents a broader pattern in smart cities: leveraging distributed resources and digital coordination to create resilient, efficient systems from assets that already exist for other purposes.",v2g_city.jpg
12,Sign 12,Alternative Water Sources,Extracting water from unexpected urban and agricultural sources,"""Tomatoes and grapes have become new 'water sources'...""","An Australian company is bringing a different kind of 'water source' to California: ""Simply put, we 'grow' water.""","Water scarcity affects growing numbers of cities globally, driven by climate change, population growth, and aquifer depletion. Traditional responses focus on conservation and efficiency, but innovative companies are exploring radical alternatives. Australian firm Botanical Water Technologies developed processes to extract water from agricultural waste - specifically tomatoes and grapes that don't meet cosmetic standards for sale. Their system extracts pure water from produce that would otherwise be discarded, creating a new water source while reducing food waste. This approach exemplifies broader trends toward circular economy thinking in urban resource management: treating waste as feedstock, creating closed-loop systems, and finding value in materials previously considered worthless. It challenges conventional water infrastructure planning that assumes supply must come from rivers, reservoirs, or desalination. As climate change makes traditional sources less reliable, cities are exploring diverse alternatives including atmospheric water generation, wastewater reuse, and now agricultural byproducts. These innovations don't replace conventional sources but create more resilient systems through diversification. They also highlight interconnections between food, water, and urban systems that planning has historically treated separately.",alt_water.jpg

Intergenerational housing represents an integrated response, designing communities specifically to facilitate interaction and mutual support across age groups. Singapore's Kampung Admiralty pioneered this approach at scale, vertically stacking senior housing, childcare facilities, medical services, retail, and community spaces within a single complex. The design creates natural intersection points where different generations encounter each other daily, building relationships that benefit all. Elderly residents gain purpose through mentoring relationships with children, combating isolation and depression. Young families access affordable childcare and eldercare in close proximity. The community becomes more resilient as residents support each other informally. This model challenges age-segregated development patterns that have dominated recent decades, treating different life stages as requiring separation rather than integration. It also addresses urban land scarcity by efficiently combining functions in vertical mixed-use structures. As populations age globally and nuclear families become less common, intergenerational design offers a path toward more supportive, sustainable urban communities.",intergenerational.jpg

Designer Jeong-in Lee's ""Around"" project reimagines second-hand commerce in virtual space, creating immersive experiences that make sustainable shopping engaging and social. Unlike conventional e-commerce platforms that reduce shopping to transactional interfaces, metaverse marketplaces offer spatial exploration, serendipitous discovery, and social interaction similar to physical markets but without geographic constraints. This model addresses multiple urban challenges: reducing material consumption and waste through circular economy enablement; creating community spaces accessible to people with mobility constraints; and demonstrating economic models for metaverse environments beyond speculation and gaming. It also represents generational shifts in how people socialize and shop, with younger cohorts comfortable mixing digital and physical experiences. For cities, metaverse development raises new questions about governance, economics, and the relationship between virtual and physical space. Will vibrant virtual markets reduce demand for physical retail space? How do cities capture economic value from digital activity? As the boundary between physical and digital urban life blurs, planners must develop frameworks addressing both realms.",metaverse_market.jpg
15,Sign 15,Renewable Street Furniture,Public infrastructure that generates its own power through integrated renewables,"""Carbon neutrality, new energy public facilities, light pollution control...""",Designer Tobias Trübenbacher developed the Papilio streetlight with integrated wind turbines that generate power through wind energy.,"Cities contain vast quantities of public infrastructure - streetlights, bus shelters, signage, traffic signals - that collectively consume enormous energy while occupying valuable urban space. Forward-thinking designers are reimagining these elements as distributed renewable energy generators and smart city nodes. The Papilio streetlight exemplifies this approach, integrating small wind turbines that generate power for illumination, eliminating grid dependence while creating distinctive urban landmarks. Similar innovations include solar-powered bus shelters with integrated information displays, kinetic pavement generating power from footsteps, and smart benches with charging stations powered by integrated photovoltaics. This trend represents a shift from viewing public infrastructure as pure cost and maintenance burden to seeing it as opportunity for energy generation, data collection, and urban amenity provision. It also addresses light pollution through smarter controls that adjust brightness based on actual need. As cities pursue carbon neutrality and smart city strategies, multifunctional infrastructure that combines services, generates energy, and improves urban quality becomes increasingly attractive. The approach reduces infrastructure costs over lifecycle while contributing to sustainability goals and creating more responsive, adaptable urban environments.",renewable_street.jpg
16,Sign 16,Structural Energy Storage,Building materials that double as batteries for renewable energy storage,"""Concrete buildings transformed into large rechargeable batteries...""",Scientists at Chalmers University of Technology are developing sustainable building materials with integrated energy storage capabilities.,"Energy storage represents one of the greatest barriers to renewable energy transition, with conventional battery production carrying significant environmental costs and spatial requirements. Researchers at Chalmers University are pioneering revolutionary building materials that store electrical energy within their structure, effectively turning entire buildings into batteries. Their concrete composite incorporates carbon fiber mesh that acts as electrodes within the material itself, storing energy chemically within the building structure. This innovation could transform how cities manage renewable energy: buildings absorb excess solar and wind power when available, then release it during high-demand periods, functioning as distributed grid batteries without requiring separate storage facilities. The technology remains early-stage, with current prototypes storing modest amounts compared to conventional batteries, but the potential is enormous. A single large building could store megawatt-hours of energy, providing grid stabilization services while offsetting its own energy consumption. This represents a broader trend toward multifunctional building systems where every component serves multiple purposes - structure, energy storage, thermal management, data transmission - rather than single-function specialization. It challenges both material science and architecture to reimagine buildings as active participants in urban energy systems.",structural_battery.jpg

The Accessible Streets Studio represents a paradigm shift toward universal design that considers the full spectrum of human ability from the outset. Their methodology involves deep engagement with disability communities, advanced sensing and mapping technologies to identify barriers, and iterative design processes that test solutions with diverse users. The work extends beyond ADA compliance - which sets minimum standards - to envision streets that actively enable independence, dignity, and full participation for everyone. This includes considerations like crossing times adequate for slower walkers, clear wayfinding for people with cognitive differences, multisensory signals for those with vision or hearing impairments, and smooth surfaces for wheeled mobility devices. The approach challenges the assumption that accessibility is a niche concern rather than a benefit for everyone - parents, delivery workers, travelers with luggage, and temporarily injured people all benefit from accessible design. As populations age and societies increasingly value inclusion, accessible street design is becoming standard practice rather than exceptional accommodation.",inclusive_streets.jpg

While governments struggle with policy frameworks, grassroots organizations are building practical infrastructure to support climate migrants. Cooperation Jackson's work in Mississippi exemplifies this approach: acquiring vacant urban properties and converting them into affordable housing, urban farms, and cooperative enterprises specifically designed to welcome climate refugees while building community resilience. This model challenges conventional disaster response and migration management by placing agency with communities rather than centralized authorities. It also integrates climate adaptation with social justice, recognizing that displacement disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. The mutual aid approach builds on historical traditions of community self-organization while incorporating modern cooperative economics and sustainable design. As climate impacts accelerate, such models offer alternatives to militarized borders and detention facilities, instead creating welcome infrastructure that benefits both newcomers and existing residents through economic development and community building.",climate_refugee.jpg

Organizations like the New Seed Society bridge this gap by supporting community-led initiatives that advance multiple SDG targets simultaneously through integrated approaches. Rather than treating education, poverty, sustainability, and inequality as separate problems requiring separate solutions, they recognize these issues as interconnected and support holistic interventions. This might include urban farming projects that provide food security, job training, community gathering spaces, and environmental education simultaneously. The network model enables knowledge sharing and resource coordination across communities facing similar challenges, accelerating innovation diffusion. This approach challenges top-down development paradigms that imposed universal solutions regardless of local context, instead enabling communities to design interventions appropriate to their specific situations while connecting them to global resources and movements. As cities increasingly become sites of SDG implementation - often more committed than national governments - such networks provide crucial infrastructure for translating ambitious goals into tangible local improvements.",regenerative_network.jpg

Symbiotic urbanism challenges this dichotomy, exploring how cities can integrate living biological systems as functional infrastructure rather than mere decoration. This includes building facades that support pollinator habitats; constructed wetlands providing water treatment; urban forests managing stormwater and heat; mycelium-based materials that grow into structural components; and bio-integrated systems where microorganisms, plants, and animals perform services like waste processing, air purification, and climate control. The approach requires radically different design thinking: architects become ecosystem designers; buildings have lifecycles more like organisms than static structures; maintenance involves ecological management rather than just repairs. Projects like bio-reactive facades that change color based on air quality, or structures built from living trees trained into desired forms, demonstrate possibilities. This movement reflects growing recognition that rigid separation between nature and city is neither sustainable nor desirable - cities must function as ecosystems, and healthy ecosystems must include human activity. It also addresses urban heat islands, biodiversity loss, resource scarcity, and disconnection from nature that affects human mental health.",symbiotic_urban.jpg

When we consider the cities of the future, it is necessary to utilize limited space as efficiently as possible, and it is anticipated that many public facilities will be designed with a view to possible future operation parameters (demographic trends) and the usage of facilities will be on a multi-functional basis wherever possible. On the other hand, the present status on the side of the government Is that they cannot handle the situation flexibly due to organizational issues caused by vertically-segmented administrative systems in addition to legal regulations. Therefore, as a measure to respond to the need for amenity as well as convenlence and efficiency where population decline and the aging of society are accelerating, there is great expectation for the recycling of public assets using asset management know-how accumulated within the private sector through utilization of public and private partnerships (PPP).",mottainai-space.jpg

Such exhibitions serve multiple functions: they make abstract futures tangible through immersive experiences; they democratize futures thinking by engaging public audiences; they create spaces for dialogue about technological and social change; and they challenge present assumptions by presenting alternatives. This represents a broader ""futures literacy"" movement recognizing that capacity to imagine and navigate multiple possible futures has become essential for citizenship and leadership. Museums are uniquely positioned to foster this literacy: they're trusted neutral spaces; they excel at communication and interpretation; they convene diverse publics; and they connect present and future to historical context.

The rise of fast fashion accelerated these impacts while creating clothing gluts in developed economies. Circular fashion models offer alternatives by extending garment lifespans through resale, repair, and recycling. Companies like Duozhuayu build urban infrastructure making circular fashion convenient: reverse logistics collecting used clothing; sorting and quality assessment facilities; online platforms connecting sellers and buyers; and community spaces for exchanges. Their expansion across major Chinese cities signals mainstreaming of secondhand consumption, particularly among younger generations increasingly rejecting fast fashion's social and environmental costs. The model benefits cities by reducing waste sent to landfills, creating local jobs in sorting and refurbishment, and providing affordable clothing access. It also enables new forms of community building around sustainable consumption values. As circular economy principles gain traction, fashion represents a crucial test case: it's a massive industry with severe impacts, but also one where consumers directly choose whether to participate in circular versus linear models.

Gas stations are particularly interesting as they occupy thousands of valuable urban sites, typically with good transportation access but contaminated soil and obsolete buildings. Rather than abandoning these sites, design firms like Surbana Jurong envision transformative reuse: repair workshops for EVs and e-bikes; package distribution micro-hubs capitalizing on location and traffic flow; covered markets or food halls serving neighborhoods; small parks or green spaces addressing urban nature deficits; or fast-charging stations with extensive amenities for the longer dwell times EV charging requires compared to gas refueling. This infrastructural transition exemplifies broader urban adaptation challenges: cities have accumulated physical infrastructure supporting particular technologies and behaviors that must evolve as societies change. The same questions apply to parking structures in autonomous vehicle futures, or office buildings if remote work dominates. Successful cities will view obsolete infrastructure as opportunity rather than liability, creatively repurposing assets to meet emerging needs while preserving embodied energy and materials.

In the case of eating habits, small-eco activities are also spreading, for example mineral water claiming ecological soundness as its basic concept gains high popularity or the number of people who grow food in their home garden as self production and self consumption is increasing. This trend can also be observed in energy consumption, such as in the permeation of LED lighting in general households. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry is also trying to enhance the motivation of the people in the reduction of the environmental burden by visualizing energy through deployment of Smart Meters, the automated meter reader of electricity consumption in every household. From now on, the focus will shift from the former vague enlightenment type eco activities at the level of society to accessible ecological activities in our daily lives where we can actually understand, act and feel the effect.",micro-eco.jpg

The trend started in England, with the title WWOOF/World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms where accommodation and meals are provided in exchange for help with farm work has now spread to 20 countries including Japan. Moreover, there are many people whose lives are based in the countryside and want to enjoy the convenience of urban life while living in natural surroundings. With this sort of background, some municipalities in rural areas adjacent to cities have started to work on inviting people stressing the appeal of compatibility with both supporting the environment of permaculture and accessibility to the city center as an additional value. In order to pursue a comfortable life that matches the individual s sense of values, the number of families who will change their work life balance dynamically along with their stage of life will increase in the future. It is also expected that local industry will be enhanced through improvement of environment and transportation put in place to accept this new population, but not only that, expansion of peripheral markets giving rise to new needs is also expected.",the-slower-the-smarter.jpg

The movement toward reducing the environmental burden has added a sense of social responsibility to purchasing activity that used to be carried out simply under one's own responsibility, and regulations covering appropriate disposal methods have become an obstacle to ownership. On the other hand, because of the increased avallability of opportunities to use a car without owning one through car sharing schemes such as Zipcar, etc. or using cloud computing, the choice of a ""life without ownership"" is now open to us. Moreover, expansion of freemium business is now changing the meaning of the price paid for ownership or usage. Increasingly, the consumer no longer sees a meaning in the simple fact of owning something. Experience gained through interaction with objects or services, formation of human relationships, personal principles or social significance are becoming more valued than a sense of ownership or being an owner. With regard to social assets, while it is becoming difficult for municipalities to develop a social infrastructure and there is a growing need for the creation of a social system through cooperation between the public and private sectors, the individual's sense of ownership of social assets is essential for sustainability and there is a strong need for a system that creates a sense of empathy and participation among the citizens.",ownership.jpg

Koen Vanmechelen's Planetary Community Chicken installation exemplifies this trend, showcasing how humans have always modified life but are now doing so with unprecedented awareness and capability. In urban contexts, biohacking manifests through community biology labs, urban farms experimenting with gene-edited crops, and individuals using technology to monitor and enhance their bodies. This democratization of biological science raises profound questions about regulation, ethics, and the future of human evolution. Cities are becoming testbeds for these experiments, with some municipalities embracing innovation districts dedicated to life sciences while others grapple with how to govern these activities. The trend suggests a future where biological modification becomes as common as digital technology, fundamentally altering our relationship with nature, health, and what it means to be human in urban environments.",biohacking_city.jpg

On the other hand, various problems are more aggravated in developed countries such as that the per capita burden is increasing along with the aging of the population combined with the diminishing number of children and the number of users of facilities has reached saturation point, so ""medical tourism"" where patients from developed countries receive medical treatment in Thailand or Singapore is growing very popular. This sort of international exchange will be crucial to both parties in order for developed countries to attain sustainable development and for developing countries to attain an affluent lifestyle. Developed countries are trying to realize a sustainable society within their borders while supporting developing countries in the construction of sophisticated and sustainable future cities, so that reverse innovation utilizing the experience and know-how gained from developing countries will be actively pursued.

This trend is not only an extension of the hobby, but it is also a sign of a ""DIY living environment"" to ""create security on your own"" due to mistrust towards distribution margins, suspicious origins and so on. This trend demonstrates the movement towards selection according to one's own sense of values through self creation or customization of products and services including private importation and asset management. It indicates that people will also desire DIY in the infrastructure held such as electricity and water supplies in the future. For instance, when household solar power generation becomes more widespread, people who use it will probably require electric companies to purchase the power generated or set pricing with consideration for volatility risk, or for social services such as marriage, insurance and pensions, a shift will probably occur toward looking for a movement into privatization through incorporating the ideas of the private sector into these institutions. As support for this social service DIY trend is propagated, customizable administrative foundations will be constructed for each region and towns that satisfy the various value mindsets of the people will spring up one after another.",diy-society.jpg

The number of public service activities in which the private sector participates will increase further, and there will be increased diversity in the type, quality and price of more convenient and user-friendly services. Moreover, as shown by the example of EV stations, with the need for a new infrastructure facility business that can be deployed as an alternative to existing energy and new technology, new and different supply methods become possible and they will be widely used. At the same time, a new production and consumption circulation system at a regional or individual level will be produced, and It is anticipated that the securing of infrastructure and management of business will be promoted beyond the existing range.",reshaped-infrastructure.jpg

In the local area, the ""police box"" used to function as a visible security channel for the area, but local convenience stores function as an anticrime base these days. The channels are diversifed. There is also a movement toward reconstructing the trust relationship of local residents that appears to be fading these days, and to protect the security of the area through joint efforts by residents. Many anticrime volunteer groups are formed and they carry out local patrols. This sort of security DIY is gaining momentum, but on the other hand, people feel anxiety toward the ""surveillance society"", so it is necessary to deliberate on this autonomy carefully in the future in order for them to agree to this.",sense-of-safety.jpg

Therefore, the preparations for accepting foreign workers will be accelerated between countries. Moreover, it is expected that there will be infrastructure development to promote and enrich the functionality of healthcare services for remote diagnosis and treatment. As one usage example for this sort of activity, a familiar place such as a convenience store has the potential to become a channel for medical care provision. On the other hand, construction plans for international medical towns are currently being promoted in various countries, so patients will be able to select medical treatment or plastic surgery services more suited to their own needs from all over the world. Along with this trend, the preparation for accepting patients between countries will be promoted, and the demand for a general coordination service for necessary procedures including medical systems, insurance and inpatient treatment will probably increase.",borderless-medical.jpg

The buying and selling of names is becoming popular, for example, the naming rights for facilities have been sought under the initiative of commercialism. This trend means not only a farewell to old familiar names, but also a resetting of people's affection or identification with the local area or the facility itself, or inherited culture and history. On the other hand, there are other cases where the affection towards the area is symbolized in a visible form by contributing a bench bearing one's own name as a memorial or where a name such as ""Metabo"" becomes popular, guides people's activities and gives rise toa huge industry. Naming can become a driving force to motivate a new social norm and arouse people's participation while the identity of the local area and community is drastically changing.",power-of-name.jpg

Along with the high speed changes in the complexity of the environment culture and human relationships around us, there is an increasing need for the capability to read the situation one is in, extract the necessary information foroneself, ascertain the truth and utilize information.

To solve this problem, someefforts are being made toward primary education through the construction of school buildings in the form of a complex with facilities for the elderly or offering sections ofthe building that are no longer used due to the dedlining birthrate as avenue for local exchange, pursuing ""education open to the local area"". On the other hand, for the senior generation, efforts are underway to improve theenvironment and allow in ""business people graduates""(creation of utilization opportunities, provision of local education) and offer IT education to solve thedigital divide for elderly people. This sort of effort to connect local people not only results in the promotion of the circulation of knowledge assets, but can also beexpected to assist in the construction of mutual aid relationships, so these types of measures will gain further recognition across the various ministries andagencies as a measure to improve efficiency of the society.",civic-education.jpg

Moreover, as the forms of employment become more diverse. services to rearrange the labor force through employment matching will increase. For example, people who have left their job but still have passion or skill are encouraged to select a new career subjectively, or they are given education or training so that they will be able to work as a driving force in society.

As an adverse effect, the ""collapse of the social security system"", ""increase in tax burden on full time workers"" and ""health problems of NEETs themselves"" due to their irregular lifestyle will put pressure on finances. However, most NEETs are skilled in the use of PCs or the Internet as they spend a lot of time on them, so they have great potential as pioneers in the information society. Some NEETs are completely different from their conventional image as ""people who withdraw from society"".

However, the immigration rules restricting entry to Japan are stricter than for other countries, so the supply of labor is insufficient despite the fact that there is a high demand for labor in manufacturing, homemaker services and agriculture, forestry and fishery industries. Strict screening is necessary to maintain order inside the country, but there is an urgent need to improve the system to facilitate smooth acceptance and to expand/fulfill the level of services. For instance, the efforts made in the nursing care field to facilitate the acceptance of caregivers and nurses through goverment-to-government agreements are expected to expand to other fields in the future. On the other hand, among Japanese aged people, the need to utilize their skills globally or meet their desire to find a purpose in life after retirement or association with other people is growing.

The number of net supermarkets or care taxi companies has increased rapidly, the number of companion animals to ease mild anxieties has increased and communication methods that work over the net have filled out in response to these issues. Various services to support security in everyday life even when living alone are beginning to emerge. This sort of service will be more important in the future because there are an increasing number of households where people choose to live alone as an individual life style not only among elderly people who separate from their spouses due to various reasons but also among the younger generation.

So, people are attempting to remain true to their diverse sense of values not only during life but also after death. People have started to look for options that reflect their identity or life style where they can remain free and true to themselves during life and after death without being bound by commonsense or customs.

Moreover, the younger generation is not so enthusiastic about owning a house or the three sacred treasures that used to be the symbol of material happiness along with marriage, but they tend rather to save up in order to ward off future unhappiness. This probably demonstrates that the investment target has changed from the purchase of consumer products that exemplify happiness to a model where value is attached to an object or event that attests to the existence of oneself in life.
