1,Sign 1,Civic Mining,Rediscovery and utilization technology for urban resources,I throw away nothing as I just "renew" things,With the further promotion of recycling we feel that everything can be recycled.,"The government has started to lay out a framework to secure overseas mineral resources. Overseas mineral resources can be secured only when the mining, development and foregn diplomacy activities related to resources are promoted through cooperation between the government and the public. In terms of funding the government is utilizing ODA (official development assistance) organically, systematically and seamlessly to actively provide support for the overseas activitles of compantes. In terms of education, the government is also publically seeking primary, junior high and high schools that actively work on education projects related to resources, energy and the environment and they provide teaching materials, data and information to selected schools. This activity forms the background for advancement of environmental education and recycling technology and the promotion of development of products with high recyclability and blodegradability; however, on the other hand, it cannot be denied that extreme competition over resources will occur on a global scale. Therefore, it Is expected that improvement in the self-sufficlency ratlo of resources and energy and expansion in the range of products using a domestic circulation flow will be even greater in the future.",civic-mining.jpg
2,Sign 2,Mottainai Space,Surplus space in the city,Getting the most of cities across generational lines,Cities will become places where amenity and convenlence are merged for city dwellers.,"Expansion in maintenance and management costs due to the aging of facilities and difficulties of flexible space usage under legal regulations are cited as issues for urban public facilities where existing resources are expected to be used effectively. When we consider the cities of the future, it is necessary to utilize limited space as efficiently as possible, and it is anticipated that many public facilities will be designed with a view to possible future operation parameters (demographic trends) and the usage of facilities will be on a multi-functional basis wherever possible. On the other hand, the present status on the side of the government Is that they cannot handle the situation flexibly due to organizational issues caused by vertically-segmented administrative systems in addition to legal regulations. Therefore, as a measure to respond to the need for amenity as well as convenlence and efficiency where population decline and the aging of society are accelerating, there is great expectation for the recycling of public assets using asset management know-how accumulated within the private sector through utilization of public and private partnerships (PPP).",mottainai-space.jpg
3,Sign 3,Beyond Green,Diversification of environmental values among people,"We are already aware that there is no justice in environmental countermeasures",We feel that the arguments for reducing the environmental burden that focus solely on reducing carbon are coming apart at the seams.,"Due to governmental measures to reduce the cost of solar power generation and promote next generation automobiles, next generation energy sources will penetrate widely into people's everyday lives through demonstrational experiments and institutional reforms. Furthermore, consumer behavior is changing from ownership to usage through expansion of the car sharing market, etc., and people are starting to choose life styles with a lower environmental burden according to varlous senses of value such as convenlence and personal principles. This sort of sense of value will become more diverse with the coming of a new generation. People that reach the age of twenty in 2025 will be of the environment native generation, who have experlenced power conservation on a large scale during their formative years, received environmental education and are thoroughly aware of the mechanism to reduce the environmental burden. The range in the sense of values regarding the reduction of the environmental burden based on differences in knowledge, generation and regional location will become wider. Moreover, environment natives who have a high degree of literacy when it comes to environmental measures will seek justice and transparency in the usage of environmental measures. If the eco-point system has failed in calculating CO2 emission reduction, it will result in a loss of empathy for the social system.",beyond-green.jpg
4,Sign 4,Micro Eco,Improvement of eco-decomposition capability,"From Eco-activities at the society level to a convincing Eco-life I can feel and be satisfied with",People are growing tired of an imposed ethical sense of values and start to seek direct motivation.,"According to an opinion poll performed by the Cabinet Office, small eco-activities that can be carried out easily by each individual such as carrying an eco-bag in order to reduce waste are gradually penetrating among the general public. In the case of eating habits, small-eco activities are also spreading, for example mineral water claiming ecological soundness as its basic concept gains high popularity or the number of people who grow food in their home garden as self production and self consumption is increasing. This trend can also be observed in energy consumption, such as in the permeation of LED lighting in general households. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry is also trying to enhance the motivation of the people in the reduction of the environmental burden by visualizing energy through deployment of Smart Meters, the automated meter reader of electricity consumption in every household. From now on, the focus will shift from the former vague enlightenment type eco activities at the level of society to accessible ecological activities in our daily lives where we can actually understand, act and feel the effect.",micro-eco.jpg
5,Sign 5,"The Slower, The Smarter",The needs for both city and nature,There is not just one ideal way of living,"I choose this town because I would like to enjoy urban life as well as life in the countryside.","The number of people who experience farming as a leisure activity or people who work on their allotment gardens seriously is increasing. The trend started in England, with the title WWOOF/World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms where accommodation and meals are provided in exchange for help with farm work has now spread to 20 countries including Japan. Moreover, there are many people whose lives are based in the countryside and want to enjoy the convenience of urban life while living in natural surroundings. With this sort of background, some municipalities in rural areas adjacent to cities have started to work on inviting people stressing the appeal of compatibility with both supporting the environment of permaculture and accessibility to the city center as an additional value. In order to pursue a comfortable life that matches the individual s sense of values, the number of families who will change their work life balance dynamically along with their stage of life will increase in the future. It is also expected that local industry will be enhanced through improvement of environment and transportation put in place to accept this new population, but not only that, expansion of peripheral markets giving rise to new needs is also expected.",slower-smarter.jpg
