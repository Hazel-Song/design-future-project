1,Sign 1,Civic Mining,Rediscovery and utilization technology for urban resources,I throw away nothing as I just "renew" things,With the further promotion of recycling we feel that everything can be recycled.,"The government has started to lay out a framework to secure overseas mineral resources. Overseas mineral resources can be secured only when the mining, development and foregn diplomacy activities related to resources are promoted through cooperation between the government and the public. In terms of funding the government is utilizing ODA (official development assistance) organically, systematically and seamlessly to actively provide support for the overseas activitles of compantes. In terms of education, the government is also publically seeking primary, junior high and high schools that actively work on education projects related to resources, energy and the environment and they provide teaching materials, data and information to selected schools. This activity forms the background for advancement of environmental education and recycling technology and the promotion of development of products with high recyclability and blodegradability; however, on the other hand, it cannot be denied that extreme competition over resources will occur on a global scale. Therefore, it Is expected that improvement in the self-sufficlency ratlo of resources and energy and expansion in the range of products using a domestic circulation flow will be even greater in the future.",civic-mining.jpg
2,Sign 2,Mottainai Space,Surplus space in the city,Getting the most of cities across generational lines,Cities will become places where amenity and convenlence are merged for city dwellers.,"Expansion in maintenance and management costs due to the aging of facilities and difficulties of flexible space usage under legal regulations are cited as issues for urban public facilities where existing resources are expected to be used effectively. When we consider the cities of the future, it is necessary to utilize limited space as efficiently as possible, and it is anticipated that many public facilities will be designed with a view to possible future operation parameters (demographic trends) and the usage of facilities will be on a multi-functional basis wherever possible. On the other hand, the present status on the side of the government Is that they cannot handle the situation flexibly due to organizational issues caused by vertically-segmented administrative systems in addition to legal regulations. Therefore, as a measure to respond to the need for amenity as well as convenlence and efficiency where population decline and the aging of society are accelerating, there is great expectation for the recycling of public assets using asset management know-how accumulated within the private sector through utilization of public and private partnerships (PPP).",mottainai-space.jpg
3,Sign 3,Beyond Green,Diversification of environmental values among people,We are already aware that there is no justice in environmental countermeasures,We feel that the arguments for reducing the environmental burden that focus solely on reducing carbon are coming apart at the seams.,"Due to governmental measures to reduce the cost of solar power generation and promote next generation automobiles, next generation energy sources will penetrate widely into people's everyday lives through demonstrational experiments and institutional reforms. Furthermore, consumer behavior is changing from ownership to usage through expansion of the car sharing market, etc., and people are starting to choose life styles with a lower environmental burden according to varlous senses of value such as convenlence and personal principles. This sort of sense of value will become more diverse with the coming of a new generation. People that reach the age of twenty in 2025 will be of the environment native generation, who have experlenced power conservation on a large scale during their formative years, received environmental education and are thoroughly aware of the mechanism to reduce the environmental burden. The range in the sense of values regarding the reduction of the environmental burden based on differences in knowledge, generation and regional location will become wider. Moreover, environment natives who have a high degree of literacy when it comes to environmental measures will seek justice and transparency in the usage of environmental measures. If the eco-point system has failed in calculating CO2 emission reduction, it will result in a loss of empathy for the social system.",beyond-green.jpg
4,Sign 4,Micro Eco,Improvement of eco-decomposition capability,From Eco-activities at the society level to a convincing Eco-life I can feel and be satisfied with,People are growing tired of an imposed ethical sense of values and start to seek direct motivation.,"According to an opinion poll performed by the Cabinet Office, small eco-activities that can be carried out easily by each individual such as carrying an eco-bag in order to reduce waste are gradually penetrating among the general public. In the case of eating habits, small-eco activities are also spreading, for example mineral water claiming ecological soundness as its basic concept gains high popularity or the number of people who grow food in their home garden as self production and self consumption is increasing. This trend can also be observed in energy consumption, such as in the permeation of LED lighting in general households. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry is also trying to enhance the motivation of the people in the reduction of the environmental burden by visualizing energy through deployment of Smart Meters, the automated meter reader of electricity consumption in every household. From now on, the focus will shift from the former vague enlightenment type eco activities at the level of society to accessible ecological activities in our daily lives where we can actually understand, act and feel the effect.",micro-eco.jpg
5,Sign 5,"The Slower, The Smarter",The needs for both city and nature,There is not just one ideal way of living,I choose this town because I would like to enjoy urban life as well as life in the countryside.,"The number of people who experience farming as a leisure activity or people who work on their allotment gardens seriously is increasing. The trend started in England, with the title WWOOF/World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms where accommodation and meals are provided in exchange for help with farm work has now spread to 20 countries including Japan. Moreover, there are many people whose lives are based in the countryside and want to enjoy the convenience of urban life while living in natural surroundings. With this sort of background, some municipalities in rural areas adjacent to cities have started to work on inviting people stressing the appeal of compatibility with both supporting the environment of permaculture and accessibility to the city center as an additional value. In order to pursue a comfortable life that matches the individual s sense of values, the number of families who will change their work life balance dynamically along with their stage of life will increase in the future. It is also expected that local industry will be enhanced through improvement of environment and transportation put in place to accept this new population, but not only that, expansion of peripheral markets giving rise to new needs is also expected.",the-slower-the-smarter.jpg
6,Sign 6,Ownership,From ownership to usership,Satisfaction is gained not only through delighting in material possessions,"Satisfaction is gained through owning the story behind the object, rather than from the approval of others or self satisfaction through purchasing products.","Throughout the world consumer activities are changing from ""ownership to usage"". The movement toward reducing the environmental burden has added a sense of social responsibility to purchasing activity that used to be carried out simply under one's own responsibility, and regulations covering appropriate disposal methods have become an obstacle to ownership. On the other hand, because of the increased avallability of opportunities to use a car without owning one through car sharing schemes such as Zipcar, etc. or using cloud computing, the choice of a ""life without ownership"" is now open to us. Moreover, expansion of freemium business is now changing the meaning of the price paid for ownership or usage. Increasingly, the consumer no longer sees a meaning in the simple fact of owning something. Experience gained through interaction with objects or services, formation of human relationships, personal principles or social significance are becoming more valued than a sense of ownership or being an owner. With regard to social assets, while it is becoming difficult for municipalities to develop a social infrastructure and there is a growing need for the creation of a social system through cooperation between the public and private sectors, the individual's sense of ownership of social assets is essential for sustainability and there is a strong need for a system that creates a sense of empathy and participation among the citizens.",ownership.jpg
7,Sign 7,Civic Price,Commoditization of cities,"Because you can see the value, you will one day encounter a city that really suits you","When it becomes possible to quantitatively compare and evaluate, the current way of life will suddenly seem to lose its color.","As the scale of the economy withers more seriously due to the aging of the population and population decrease, it will become difficult to maintain infrastructure facilities in cities. Municipalities are required to make an independent effort to present their attractions in a manner that facilitates comparison with other cities for the purpose of attracting people and industries in order to survive. Against this background, international organizations including the United Nations presented a universal method for measuring the CO2 emissions of each city and actually calculated the emissions of major cities around the world, so various ""indexes to evaluate the urban environment"" have started to appear. These indexes will be used effectively to indicate the characteristics of urban development to associated bodies in the development of special zones. Reduction in the environmental burden will not be the only factor in regenerating a city or establishing a new city. One important factor that might make one city stand out in comparison with others for potential residents may be the extent to which it is equipped with functionality that supports a more diverse set of values, which includes basic performance factors such as safety, security and convenience, participation of aged people in the community, consideration of the work life balance such as proximity of the work place and home and an understanding of diversity.",civic-price.jpg
8,Sign 8,Emerging Community,New relationships with developing countries,The future of one's own country can first be seen through support for other countries,New state-to-state relations can be constructed through mutual development ald.,"In recent years, an increasing number of developed countries are trying to contribute to the development of fast-growing developing countries through urban creation Industries such as the construction of smart cities. On the other hand, various problems are more aggravated in developed countries such as that the per capita burden is increasing along with the aging of the population combined with the diminishing number of children and the number of users of facilities has reached saturation point, so ""medical tourism"" where patients from developed countries receive medical treatment in Thailand or Singapore is growing very popular. This sort of international exchange will be crucial to both parties in order for developed countries to attain sustainable development and for developing countries to attain an affluent lifestyle. Developed countries are trying to realize a sustainable society within their borders while supporting developing countries in the construction of sophisticated and sustainable future cities, so that reverse innovation utilizing the experience and know-how gained from developing countries will be actively pursued. It is actually the country that gives the support, who receives the support*",emerging-community.jpg
9,Sign 9,DIY Society,DIY oriented society,"Public... you won' tfind it no matter how hard you look, we are the public",People want hand-made towns after their experience of ready-made towns such as designated districts.,"The number of people enjoying home gardening is increasing. This trend is not only an extension of the hobby, but it is also a sign of a ""DIY living environment"" to ""create security on your own"" due to mistrust towards distribution margins, suspicious origins and so on. This trend demonstrates the movement towards selection according to one's own sense of values through self creation or customization of products and services including private importation and asset management. It indicates that people will also desire DIY in the infrastructure held such as electricity and water supplies in the future. For instance, when household solar power generation becomes more widespread, people who use it will probably require electric companies to purchase the power generated or set pricing with consideration for volatility risk, or for social services such as marriage, insurance and pensions, a shift will probably occur toward looking for a movement into privatization through incorporating the ideas of the private sector into these institutions. As support for this social service DIY trend is propagated, customizable administrative foundations will be constructed for each region and towns that satisfy the various value mindsets of the people will spring up one after another.",diy-society.jpg
10,Sign 10,Reshaped Infrastructure,Reviewing the aging infrastructure,To whom can we entrust this valuable property?,We'd like to entrust this to a rellable party because this infrastructure will be an essential part of our everyday lives In the future.,"In the case of social infrastructure including roads, public facilities, water and electricity that used to be controlled and operated mainly by the public administration, countermeasures against aging are now becoming a big issue.Due to various reasons such as resource depletion, cost collapse, risk measures in an emergency and changes in the individual's consciousness of ownership and usage, the role of public projects themselves have become open to re-examination. The number of public service activities in which the private sector participates will increase further, and there will be increased diversity in the type, quality and price of more convenient and user-friendly services. Moreover, as shown by the example of EV stations, with the need for a new infrastructure facility business that can be deployed as an alternative to existing energy and new technology, new and different supply methods become possible and they will be widely used. At the same time, a new production and consumption circulation system at a regional or individual level will be produced, and It is anticipated that the securing of infrastructure and management of business will be promoted beyond the existing range.",reshaped-infrastructure.jpg
11,Sign 11,Sense of Safety,Hyperawareness of perceived public security/observed public security,How can we eliminate the anxiety we have uncovered?,Knowledge and perception are sufficiently enhanced for us to be able to be confdent of our own safety Public security "perceived public security' that people feel or sense subjectively is getting worse.,"Anticrime facilities such as surveillance cameras are widespread among households, and anticrime robots for the household are expected to play a part in the future. In the local area, the ""police box"" used to function as a visible security channel for the area, but local convenience stores function as an anticrime base these days. The channels are diversifed. There is also a movement toward reconstructing the trust relationship of local residents that appears to be fading these days, and to protect the security of the area through joint efforts by residents. Many anticrime volunteer groups are formed and they carry out local patrols. This sort of security DIY is gaining momentum, but on the other hand, people feel anxiety toward the ""surveillance society"", so it is necessary to deliberate on this autonomy carefully in the future in order for them to agree to this.",sense-of-safety.jpg
12,Sign 12,Borderless Medical,Eliminating the borders for medical services,"Anytime, anywhere,
personal health care just for me",To gain "my one and only" healthy life in the world.,"There is a growing shortage in the number of healthcare personnel due to the worldwide increase in population and aging of the population, so there will be a more active exchange of human resources across country borders. Therefore, the preparations for accepting foreign workers will be accelerated between countries. Moreover, it is expected that there will be infrastructure development to promote and enrich the functionality of healthcare services for remote diagnosis and treatment. As one usage example for this sort of activity, a familiar place such as a convenience store has the potential to become a channel for medical care provision. On the other hand, construction plans for international medical towns are currently being promoted in various countries, so patients will be able to select medical treatment or plastic surgery services more suited to their own needs from all over the world. Along with this trend, the preparation for accepting patients between countries will be promoted, and the demand for a general coordination service for necessary procedures including medical systems, insurance and inpatient treatment will probably increase.",borderless-medical.jpg

20,Sign 20,NEET to go,Transition of NEET population,Not working; the new way of working,Supporting society together in cooperation with the increasing ranks of unemployed people.,"The number of NEETs (Not in Employment, Education or Training) is increasing below the surface, and it is estimated that it will exceed a million in 2020. This problem is not unique to Japan, but it is increasing in England, the country of origin for this expression and in China, too. As an adverse effect, the ""collapse of the social security system"", ""increase in tax burden on full time workers"" and
""health problems of NEETs themselves"" due to their irregular lifestyle will put pressure on finances. However, most NEETs are skilled in the use of PCs or the Internet as they spend a lot of time on them, so they have great potential as pioneers in the information society. Some NEETs are completely different from their conventional image as ""people who withdraw from society"". They have grown up in middle class families and have a high degree of academic achievement, but they fail to be interested in ""status, fame or money"" because they have experienced the deceleration of the economy through their parents, so they do not join an organization, but they value ""human relationships and friendship"" and they are outgoing. It is necessary to understand their sense of values towards labor, improve new occupational opportunities and seek contact points for social participation in the future.",neet-to-go.jpg
21,Sign 21,Global Empowerment,Necessity for international human resources,Skills are my passport,I am needed somewhere in the world.,"The domestic labor population will fall by 17% in 2030. We will be facing an crisis of falling birth rate and aging population. This means we will actually be facing a situation where it is in fact impossible for us to support the society and economy of our own country by ourselves. However, the immigration rules restricting entry to Japan are stricter than for other countries, so the supply of labor is insufficient despite the fact that there is a high demand for labor in manufacturing, homemaker services and agriculture, forestry and fishery industries. Strict screening is necessary to maintain order inside the country, but there is an urgent need to improve the system to facilitate smooth acceptance and to expand/fulfill the level of services.
For instance, the efforts made in the nursing care field to facilitate the acceptance of caregivers and nurses through goverment-to-government agreements are expected to expand to other fields in the future. On the other hand, among Japanese aged people, the need to utilize their skills globally or meet their desire to find a purpose in life after retirement or association with other people is growing. Agency business for entering overseas companies or markets to support
""long term overseas stays"" will expand, however, it will also be necessary to keep competent senior workers within Japan taking into account the decrease in the number of foreign workers after the earthquake disaster.",global-empowerment.jpg
22,Sign 22,Singleship,Single person safety net,"""Single family"" lifestyle","I found the way for a secure, safe and happy life even alone.","The number of small households including elderly people saying they ""wish to live alone without causing trouble for the children"" and ""working mothers"" is increasing. This does give rise to some issues, where these people become isolated from others and have difficulty in even small activities such as day to day shopping due to various physical, time oriented or economic restrictions limiting their behavior. The number of net supermarkets or care taxi companies has increased rapidly, the number of companion animals to ease mild anxieties has increased and communication methods that work over the net have filled out in response to these issues. Various services to support security in everyday life even when living alone are beginning to emerge. This sort of service will be more important in the future because there are an increasing number of households where people choose to live alone as an individual life style not only among elderly people who separate from their spouses due to various reasons but also among the younger generation. It is expected that there will be a fuller range of administrative measures including a social system to protect single families and small households and provision of education on ""lifestyle technologies"" that promote safety, security and amenity.",singleship.jpg
23,Sign 23,Wishloops,Diversification of last wishes,Ego of living and passing away freely,Live true to one's identity and life style.,"These days people referred to as ""Ohitori-sama (single)* who enjoy an active single life are drawing a lot of attention, so a way of living without ties to conservative commonsense or a sense of values is growing more accepted by society in general. The status after death based on the wishes of the deceased is becoming more diverse such as in ""tree funerals"" where a tree is planted in the place of a grave stone, and there are cases where electronic data is received as an inheritance taking the place of assets in the form of land or money. So, people are attempting to remain true to their diverse sense of values not only during life but also after death. People have started to look for options that reflect their identity or life style where they can remain free and true to themselves during life and after death without being bound by commonsense or customs.
When people have the self awareness to ""live and pass away freely"", we need to consider a social system that does not place an excessive burden on future generations while remaining open to their wishes.",wishloops.jpg
24,Sign 24,Model of Family,Diversification of the concept of marriage/concept of family,My concept of family is just like a community,"There should be a ""bond"" more suited to me, easier and more comfortable.","Due to the influence of the global recession and the popularization of a liberal way of thinking about lifestyle, more people have started to doubt the traditional concepts or forms of ""marriage"" or ""household"", and discussion over the hurdle or economic burden of marriage has risen to the surface. As a result, the wedding may not be the ""greatest event in life"" any more among young people, and there has been a big upsurge in the concept of marriage as one option or a re-doable event. Moreover, the younger generation is not so enthusiastic about owning a house or the three sacred treasures that used to be the symbol of material happiness along with marriage, but they tend rather to save up in order to ward off future unhappiness. This probably demonstrates that the investment target has changed from the purchase of consumer products that exemplify happiness to a model where value is attached to an object or event that attests to the existence of oneself in life. The diversification in the concept of marriage and family produces completely new ""family units"", so new measures are required including the fostering of environments that will accept such units and suitable systems/services for their support.",model-of-family.jpg
25,Sign 25,Missing Reality,Ambiguity in boundaries of awareness in communication,"where is my consciousness now?
Cogito, ergo sum?",Experiencing difficulty in identifying whether an idea is my own or someone else s.,"The number of users of social network services has increased, and a lot of information is sent over the net, so social networks have become communication networks on a global scale exceeding the framework of company or country borders. We record information as ""memos"" for ourselves and handle information recorded by other people as ""memos"", too. People do not or cannot any longer distinguish whether the information was put there by them or some other. The boundary between primary and secondary production becomes ambiguous when social communication is handled as an external memory device and opinions or information are quoted or used. When you copy the ideas of others, you take them on as though they are your own original creations, and a behavioral chain occurs. This is the ""ambiguity in boundaries of awareness"", and it marks a change in human consciousness through social communication.",missing-reality.jpg
